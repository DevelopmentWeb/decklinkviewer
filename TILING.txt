Support for tiling multiple cards will be simple
and restrictive at first; more complex versions
should be possible once the basics are sorted out.

For now, if the -t option is given, we'll try to
use all available cards in the tiling. We assume
a simple left to right tiling beginning with the
lowest numbered card on theleft. We also assume (for now)
that all capture cards are the same. With different
cards, capabilities and modes (and therefore their
capability numbering) may be different.
When we support different cards, we will first try to
apply whatever settings were given by the user to card 0.
Assuming that succeeds, we'd look for the corresponding
capability id's to use in the other cards. Of course we'd
have to insist that whatever options the user supplies
are available in each card i.e. each card would use the
same input type (HDMI, Component etc.), and pixel mode
(1080i50, 720p etc.).

Later we should be able to:
- use only a subset of the available cards
- mix the order of the tiling
- different tiling shapes e.g. 2x2 instead of 4x1
